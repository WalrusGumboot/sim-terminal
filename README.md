# SIM-TERMINAL

SIM-TERMINAL is a utility tool to quickly calculate things, create new files or perform bulk operations on a large group of files.

## FUNCTIONALITY

Most functions can be called with or without parameters.
When you call a function that supports optional parameters, for example ```dvs()```, SIM-TERMINAL will prompt you with 
```dvs > input? > ```.
However, ```dvs(420)``` will immediately return the integer divisors of 420.

## AESTHETICS

All SIM-TERMINAL functions consist of three letters.
They're inspired by Assembly.
