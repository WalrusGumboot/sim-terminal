#SIM-TERMINAL
SIM-TERMINAL is a utility tool to quickly calculate things, create new files or perform bulk operations on a large group of files.

##AESTHETICS
All SIM-TERMINAL functions consist of three letters.
They're inspired by Assembly.

##FUNCTIONALITY
All functions can be called with or without parameters.
When you call a function, for example ```dvs()```, SIM-TERMINAL will prompt you with ```dvs > input? > ```.
However, ```dvs(420)``` will immediately return the integer divisors of 420.
