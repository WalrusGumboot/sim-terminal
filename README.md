# SIM-TERMINAL

SIM-TERMINAL is a utility tool to quickly calculate things, create new files or perform bulk operations on a large group of files.

## FUNCTIONALITY

Most functions can be called with or without parameters.
When you call a function that supports optional parameters, for example `dvs()`, SIM-TERMINAL will prompt you with
`dvs > input? > `.
However, ```dvs(420)``` will immediately return the integer divisors of 420.
